# Simple Full-stack Dapp Using React, Ethers, Solidity, and Hardhat

## Project Summary

- This project is created for learning purposes
- In this project, the dapp connects to a couple of smart simple smart contracts:
  1. A greeting contract for creating and updating messages on the Ethereum Blockchain
  2. A simple contract for minting tokens and allowing the owner of the contract to send out tokens
     in addition to allowing them to read their token balance

## Learning Goals

- How to create, deploy, and test Ethereum smart contracts
- How to switch between different environments / networks
- How to connect and interact with contracts via a React frontend

## Stack

- React
- Ethers
- Hardhat
